Problem?
Music is naturally an important part in life. Everyone loves music not just to listen, but to sing as well. But the traditional way of teaching music has some disadvantages:

High cost of learning due to lack of educators. Cost of learning music is high due to some reasons. One of them is the limitation of music educators’ time. And for some regions, there are not enough music educators to cover the public needs.
Extra cost on Instruments & Travel Teaching and learning require instruments as teaching material, and the physical presence. Therefore it may cause extra cost (instruments, travel).
Solution: Muzikator
We want to make an application that can solve those problems, and make music lessons easy to everyone. That’s why we want to build Muzikator, a music educator application that everyone would love. Educational, Collaborative & Fun.
